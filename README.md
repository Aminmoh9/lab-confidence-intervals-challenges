# Lab | Confidence Intervals Challenges

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll explore the concept of confidence intervals by using sample data to estimate population parameters and understand the uncertainty in those estimates.

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
